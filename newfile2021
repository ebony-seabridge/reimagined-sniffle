Does Code work here? <b>I don't think so</b>

Is a new file going to change anything?

Still trying to find out how to use Github.

Successfully created an issue and closed it with a pull request and a merge.

This repo DOES still work for Hacktoberfest.

These changes probably aren't considered quality changes but I'm still trying to figure out how to use Github.
